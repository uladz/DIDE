## Features

The following fixes and changes are incorporated to this DIDE modpack. Feel free to mod it further.

**Fixes:**
- Added missing legendary items in all loot boxes around all the maps in the game. Now you have a chance to loot higher level legendaries even after you received it as a quest reward.
- Added missing loot table in the laboratory that resulted in all chests, boxes, etc. having only money and alcohol. Includes legendary loot fix as well.
- Fixed kick doing too much critical damage. Lowered from 40% to 20%. It doesn't change the feel of the game much except now it's not that easy to kill zombies by kicking them on the ground.
- Fixed bomb blueprints missing watch component while they clearly require one as the rest of explosives in the game.
- Fixed legendary weapons missing from blueprints requiring a baseball bat as a base weapon. This is clearly a bug in the game code as other legendary bats can be modded.
- Fixed Homerun using Nail'd blueprint while it's a metal bat, not wooden. Instead added it to Nuts & Bolts blueprint. 

**Improvements:**
- Level cap for all heros increased from 60 to 100. This allows you to keep leveling and getting skill points to eventually open the whole skill tree if you want. Note that amount of required xp for each next level is around 11% more than the previous one, leveling after level 60 will be progressively hard.
- After level 20, each 5 levels heros will gain 5 health points. Before max health level was reached at 20 and that's it. This makes leveling a bit more meaningful.
- Deep Pockets skill for all heros was 2x buffed to allow carrying extra 4, 8, 12 items in inventory making this skill worth investing skill points too.
- Now all heros can carry up to 100 pistol ammo, 150 rifle ammo, and 50 shotgun shells. Ammo is very rare and scarce in the island, better stock up!
- Purna's Rain of Bullets skill now gives her additional 20 pistol ammo, 30 rifle ammo, 10 shotgun shells. This puts on par with buffed ammo carry capacity.
- Purna's Gun Kata skill now also gives extra 5% critical bullet damage. This makes it a bit more useful and makes sense as all other damage attributes are buffed with this skill.

**Other Changes:**
- Before unused Sonic Pulse Grenade was added back to Cahaya's shop in Moresby. Let's have some explosive fun!
- Now chainsaw can be repaired just like in Dead Island Riptide. Not sure why it was made non-repairable in the first place.
